[EAEE4000] Machine Learning for Environmental Engineers & Scientists

Andrew Fagerheim, Bernard Wang course project

Our project will involve working with ML models to study submesoscale (~10-20km) structures of buoyancy fluxes. We will be using a dataset provided by Dhruv Balwada of high-resolution inputs of physical 
terms related to buoyancy from the MITgcm-LLC4320 model. The output will be predictions of buoyancy flux.

Our goal is to test different models, input combinations, and hyperparameters to create an efficient output of buoyancy flux. Since performance is important to sub-grid model parametrization, it'll be an
important consideration in our project too. We plan to start with testing NNs and CNNs, and possibly other archictures disccused in the course as well.

In addition to having our code, this repo has meeting notes, tasks, references, etc related to the project organized under Issues. The final deliverables for this project will be:
- [slides]()
- [project report]()
